# Decentralised P2P Lending System

Hi, welcome to the repository for P2P Lending System (PPLS). This dApp is developed within one semester under the guidance of Prof Nicholas Mac Gregor Garcia in NUS IS4302 Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies.

The Peer-to-Peer Lending System (PPLS) represents a transformative leap in the lending landscape, transcending mere liquidity provision to introduce a higher level of utility to the lending process. By enabling users to pool their tokens collectively, the system empowers borrowers to access larger sums while allowing lenders the opportunity to earn interest on their contributions. This collaborative paradigm sets the stage for a dynamic lending environment that optimizes advantages for all participants.

Within this system, borrowers leverage their previously illiquid digital assets as collateral to initiate a request for borrowing ETH. This request encompasses critical details such as the borrowing duration, the proposed interest rate, and the specific amount of ETH sought. Once this request is submitted to the system, lenders are promptly notified of its presence. They hold the discretion to assess the request's viability and, if found reasonable, choose to contribute their ETH to the pool. As a result, they stand to accrue interest based on their stake in the request.

Upon successful fulfillment of the request, the borrowed ETH is promptly transmitted to the borrower's designated address. As the borrowing duration reaches its conclusion, the borrower, in adherence to the pre-defined terms, duly repays the borrowed ETH along with the agreed-upon interest. Subsequently, lenders receive not only their initially staked ETH but also the interest accrued from their participation.

This streamlined process ensures that all stakeholders, whether they are borrowers seeking financial flexibility or lenders aiming to grow their holdings, engage in a transparent and mutually beneficial lending ecosystem. By embracing this collaborative ethos, the PPLS not only addresses liquidity concerns but also introduces an elevated level of efficiency and inclusivity into the lending experience. This innovative approach seeks to redefine the traditional lending paradigm, unlocking greater financial opportunities and accessibility for all participants involved.
